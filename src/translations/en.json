These networks will be able to recover renewable and waste heat which is available at low temperature. In the project, an energy system model of seven countries (Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden) heating sector has been developed and used to explore the scenarios to explore scenarios for transition to low-temperature district heating and carbon neutrality in these countries.",

The scheme and the graph below inform you about the scenarios and options. For further information about these please go to the 'Description of the scenarios' tab on the left.",
