# REWARDHeat key findings in short 

- **...** Fuel and technology mix for heat supply varies over time and by 2050, individual ground-source heat pumps (and/or ambient-temp. source heat pumps) become the main competitor of DH in the case countries.
 

- **...** Share of DH of total heat supply increases by 2050 in all the countries (except for Denmark and Sweden, i.e. remains unchanged).


- **...** Climate policy of “zero CO2 emissions by 2030” is of benefit of individual heat pumps in buildings.
 

- **...** DH fuel and technology mix varies over time and by 2050, solar, industrial EH, biomass


- **...** Cost-efficient utilization of low-temp. heat sources (urban excess heat and ambient-temp. heat) in large-scale heat pumps increase the competitiveness of DH in heating of buildings.


- **...** The availability of urban excess heat is larger than what is cost-efficient to use.


- **...** Balanced shares of large-scale heat pumps based on low-temperature heat sources can lower system cost 

- **...** When large potentials of high-temperature EH sources (industrial EH and Geothermal heat) and solar energy are available, the cost-efficient use of low-temperature EH sources is limited.
  

- **...** The least primary energy use in 2050 is related to the combination of “FutureDH” and the “CO2 free” scenarios. 
 

- **...** The role of large-scale heat pumps in DH in a future with a completely decarbonized heating sector is dependent on the ability of the electricity sector to decarbonize.

- **...** Excess heat from ”Data centers” is more cost-efficient to be utilized compared to other urban excess heat sources (“Metro stations”, “Sewage systems” and “Cooling systems of buildings” (high availability and less temperature variations).
