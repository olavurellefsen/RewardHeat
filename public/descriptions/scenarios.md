# REWARDHeat scenario description

For the purposes of RewardHeat project, 9 senarios were developed and modeled in TIMES model generator. These 9 scenarios result from a combination of 3 heat supply scenarios and 3 climate policy options.

## Three heat supply scenarios

**Conventional DH - Conventional district heating without low temperature heat sources** In this scenario the current DH systems remains without low temperature heating sources.

**Transition DH - Conventional district heating with low temperature heat sources** In this scenario the current DH technologies are in place. In additon to this low temperature heating sources are introdcued to the system. 

**Future DH - Low Temperature district heating with low temperature heat sources** Low temperature district heating technologies are introducted with the availability of low temperature heating sources.

## Three climate policy options

Key aspects (options) for the emission reduction that can be varied in our scenarios include: 

**Ambitious - Net zero emission by 2030 compared to 2015** Local and international CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction of 100% by 2030 compared to 2015

**WEO-SD - World Energy Oulook Sustainable Development Scenario total CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by 95% by 2050 compared to 2015** Local and international CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction of 95% by 2050 compared to 2015

**WEO-NP - World Energy Oulook New Policies Scenario total CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by 60% by 2050 compared to 2015** Local and international CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction of 60% by 2050 compared to 2015
