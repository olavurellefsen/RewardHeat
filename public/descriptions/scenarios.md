# REWARDHeat scenario description

....

In the analysis, three climate policy scenarios, combined into three heat supply scenarios (resulting in nine different scenarios), were designed and applied to assess the span of outcomes with regards to parameter values for which future levels are uncertain and of relevance for the present study.

The first scenario is the "Ambitous scenario", the target is net zero emission by 2030. The two climate policy scenarios chosen: "WEO-SD" and "WEO-NP", are in line with the Sustainable Development Scenario and the New Policies Scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA)â€™s World Energy Outlook 2017 (WEO) report, respectively. The Sustainable Development scenario is a more ambitious climate policy scenario that starts with a certain vision of what the energy sector needs to achieve and then works back to the present. In contrast, The New Policies Scenario is a less ambitious climate policy scenario that aims to provide a sense of where today's policy ambitions seem likely to take the energy sector.
 

## Three scenarios

Conventional DH: In this scenario the current DH systems remain in place. 

Transition DH: In this scenario the current DH technolgies are in place. In additon to this low temperature heating sources are introdcued to the system. 

4th Generation DH: Low temperature district heating technologies are introducted with the availability of low temperature heating sources.

## Three possible switches

Key aspects (switches) for the emission reduction that can be varied in our scenarios include: 

### Net zero emission by 2030 compared to 2015 (Ambitious)

... 

### 95% emission reduction by 2050 compared to 2015 (WEO-SD)

... 

### 60 % emission reduction by 2050 compared to 2015 (WEO-NP)

...
