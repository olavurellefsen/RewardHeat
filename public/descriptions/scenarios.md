# REWARDHeat scenario description

....

In the analysis, three climate policy options, combined into three heat supply scenarios (resulting in nine different scenarios), were designed and applied to assess the span of outcomes with regards to parameter values for which future levels are uncertain and of relevance for the present study.

The first climate policy option is the "Ambitous", the target is net zero emission by 2030 compared to 2015. The two climate policy options chosen: "WEO-SD" and "WEO-NP", are in line with the Sustainable Development Scenario and the New Policies Scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA)â€™s World Energy Outlook 2017 (WEO) report, respectively. The Sustainable Development scenario is a more ambitious climate policy option that starts with a certain vision of what the energy sector needs to achieve and then works back to the present. In contrast, The New Policies Scenario is a less ambitious climate policy option that aims to provide a sense of where today's policy ambitions seem likely to take the energy sector.

## Three scenarios

**Conventional DH - Conventional district heating without low temperature heat sources** In this scenario the current DH systems remains without low temperature heating sources.

**Transition DH - Conventional district heating with low temperature heat sources** In this scenario the current DH technologies are in place. In additon to this low temperature heating sources are introdcued to the system. 

**Future DH - Low Temperature district heating without low temperature heat sources** Low temperature district heating technologies are introducted with the availability of low temperature heating sources.

## Three possible options

Key aspects (options) for the emission reduction that can be varied in our scenarios include: 

**Ambitious - Net zero emission by 2030 compared to 2015** Local and international CO2 emission reduction of 100% by 2030 compared to 2015

**WEO-SD - World Energy Oulook Sustainable Development Scenario total CO2 reduction by 95% by 2050 compared to 2015** Local and international CO2 emission reduction of 95% by 2050 compared to 2015

**WEO-NP - World Energy Oulook New Policies Scenario total CO2 reduction by 60% by 2050 compared to 2015** Local and international CO2 emission reduction of 60% by 2050 compared to 2015
