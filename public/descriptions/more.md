# About the model 

In the study, the well-established TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) energy system model is used for the analysis (ETSAP, M. Gargiulo, 2009).
A TIMES model can be used to optimize energy systems over a mid- to long-term horizon. The model is driven by exogenously given demands for energy services and based on a perfect-foresight, linear programming bottom-up approach, where the objective function is minimization of the total system cost. The studied energy system is represented by different processes that are connected by flows of commodities. Each process (such as an energy conversion technology) is described, e.g., by its input and output commodities, efficiency, availability, lifetime and costs, whereas each commodity (such as a fuel) is described by its availability, extraction or import cost and environmental impacts.
For this study, a TIMES models representing the heat sectors of the studied countries was developed, hereafter referred to as the TIMES_Heat model. The TIMES_Heat model represents the heat sectors in the countries, including both the heat generation in DH systems and in individual heating units in buildings. The electricity system as well as international markets for fuels are treated exogenously.
